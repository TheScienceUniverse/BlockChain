\chapter*{Abstract}
Images are electronic documents that plays an important role in the society to store and give some information about some event as a historical document. With the digitalization in developing country like India there comes image scams with the image editing tools. We can not use a normal database to maintain the context of the image because a server's security can be compromised by the hackers or the masters of the internet and electronic devices with the flaws of technology.
An emerging technology \textit{i.e.} BlockChain can be used to store the data (here image) in such a way that before storing it is verified and no one can change the data as it is a peer-to-peer decentralized network of a group of people where everybody is having a copy of public ledger containing information of a portion having the image in it.
We created a system that serves users a social media platform to store images and verify an image by checking in our system.
It is not easy to create a blockchain and it is about impossible to change the data of blockchain because it works collaboratively.\\
