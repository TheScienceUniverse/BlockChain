Block
	Id
	Timestamp
	Data
	Prev hash
	Nonce



As we are implementing in Java, there are publicly functioning classes along with a class containing main function.

The classes we have are:
	Block
	Transaction
	String Utility
	Main

For containing the hashes we are using List datatype in Java. Before adding any block we are checking 3 things, that are:

Timestamp: The time that it has been created
Previous Hash: parent for current block
Nonce: Consensus mechanism

In the transaction class we have,
	Source Name (Hash): transaction from
	Destination Name (Hash): transaction to
	Sum: 

From main, we are
	creating transactions: calling Transaction class
	visiting transactions: receiving hashes
